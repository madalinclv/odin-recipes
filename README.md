The project is about creating a site using only HTML notions learned up until the present moment, April 2nd, 2025 -

What I have learned after completing the project :
  Well, first off, I have refined my HTML skills by actually practicing what I have learned and read about. I've became faster at writing the code without needing assistance such as looking back at what's needed or constantly switching between web pages to remind myself how to do the task at hand.

  I am currently planning to return to this project further down the line, to refine it and transform it into the vision I have of it, improving the visual and functional aspect of it.
